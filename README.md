- Self-balancing mechanism
- Adjustable controller for stability
- Modular design that allows easy assembly
- Compatible with various 3D printers

## Contents
- **Hardware:** Contains schematics, STL files, and other hardware-related resources.
- **Software:** Includes code written in the Beaglebone.
- **Documentation:** Detailed instructions, tutorials, and troubleshooting tips.
- **Extras:** Additional resources, such as 3D print tips.

## Getting Started
To start building your own balancing robot, follow these steps:
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Review the hardware and software requirements listed in the documentation.
3. Assemble the hardware components according to the provided schematics.
